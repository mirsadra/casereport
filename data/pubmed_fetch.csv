Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome type II with crossed fused renal ectopia: A rare case report.,"Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by agenesis or aplasia of the uterus. Patients usually present with primary amenorrhea. MRKH can be isolated (type I) or accompanied by other malformations (type II) involving the kidney, skeletal, and vascular systems. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the mainstay of imaging modality in evaluating this syndrome. A 20-year-old woman presented with cyclic abdominal pain and primary amenorrhea. Secondary sexual characteristics and hormone evaluation were normal. Ultrasound and MRI were conducted and revealed no normal uterus structure with ectopic ovarium and crossed fused ectopic renal.",Radiology case reports,eng,2023,5.0
Urethral Caruncle with Associated Renoureteric Anomalies.,"A urethral caruncle is a rare differential diagnosis for a prolapsed mass at the urethral meatus. The aetiopathogenesis of this entity is unclear. We report a three-year-old female patient who presented to a tertiary care teaching hospital in India in 2019 with intermittent bleeding from the introitus for a month. Investigations revealed a urethral caruncle and associated renal anomalies which has not been described in the previous literature. The patient was discharged with a prescription of a Sitz bath twice daily and advised to apply betamethasone (0.1%) cream locally once daily. There was a significant improvement after six weeks of therapy; at two-years follow-up, the lesion had disappeared completely.",Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,eng,2023,2.0
A Rare Case of Crossed Non-fused Ectopic Kidney.,"Crossed and non-fused kidneys are an exceedingly rare congenital anomaly in which one or both kidneys cross the midline to the opposite side. At the same time, the ureters are inserted in their normal anatomical locations in the bladder. Although crossed ectopic kidneys are mostly asymptomatic and incidentally discovered during workup for other disorders, they are prone to urological complications such as urinary tract infections (UTIs). Here we present the case of a 12-year-old male with a history of recurrent UTIs and urinary retention who presented to the emergency department with recurrent UTIs and urinary retention and was eventually found to have an ectopic unfused left kidney in the right lumbar region on computed tomography (CT).",Cureus,eng,2022,11.0

Obstructed hemivagina with ipsilateral renal and urinary tract anomaly presenting as an unusual cause of acute abdomen: a radiologic perspective.,"Obstructed hemivagina with ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) is a rare congenital genitourinary defect with a triad of unilateral vaginal obstruction, uterine anomaly and ipsilateral renal agenesis. This paper reports an unusual presentation of OHVIRA, with our patient experiencing severe abdominal pain from a left tubo-ovarian abscess that is contralateral to the side of the vaginal outflow obstruction. Another reportable finding is our patient's rare association of a trifid ureter that fuses distally before inserting ectopically in her vaginal canal. Lastly, this case report also emphasises the importance of radiologists' expertise in suspecting the diagnosis early on and in contributing to the preoperative evaluation of patients with OHVIRA, thereby providing adequate management for these patients.",BMJ case reports,eng,2022,6.0

Primary Chondrosarcoma in L-shaped Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia Coexisting with Papillary Urothelial Carcinoma in Urinary Bladder - An Enigmatic Entity with Poor Prognosis.,"Primary renal chondrosarcomas are rare tumors that are high-grade in nature and, unfortunately, have poorly understood pathogenesis and extremely low prognosis. The coexistence of a discrete malignancy in the urinary bladder is even rarer, with the occurrence of distinct papillary urothelial carcinoma in the urinary bladder in this case. The clinical presentation is nonspecific, and the primary radiological investigations have a limited scope in providing specific diagnosis of this entity. The final diagnosis is possible on thorough histopathological examination of the resected specimen, which requires extensive sampling and meticulous reporting. As of now, the only way to achieve a better prognosis is by early diagnosis. It is necessary to keep the possibility of occurrence of sarcomas at rare sites in the differential diagnoses. The cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities associated with this entity need to be elucidated to achieve a more satisfactory outcome concerning the overall management of the patient.",Journal of kidney cancer and VHL,eng,2022,
Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia With Acute Pyelonephritis: A Case Report.,"Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia (CFRE) is a very rare anomaly of the kidneys with a prevalence of 1 in 1000 live births. In this condition, both kidneys are fused together on one side of the spine. Usually, CFRE is an asymptomatic condition and is mostly detected incidentally, but sometimes the patient may develop various renal signs and symptoms.

Crossed fused renal ectopia (pancake type) with single ureter: A case report.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia is a rare congenital anomaly of renal embryogenesis. The majority of such anomalous kidneys are supplied by a single renal artery and drained by two separate ureters. However, drainage by a single common ureter is an unusual variant. Here, we present a 17-year old male with a pelvic pancake kidney drained by a single ureter with associated acute obstructive uropathy diagnosed with ultrasonography and computed tomography urography (CTU). We describe the anatomical peculiarity and diagnostic evaluation of the case.",Urology case reports,eng,2021,11.0
Case Report on Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia With a Large Calculus and Its Management.,"Among congenital renal anomalies, the ectopic kidney is a rare occurrence. Crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) - an even rarer subtype of ectopic kidney - is characterized by both kidneys being fused together on one side of the spine. CFRE is usually asymptomatic but can present with vague symptoms if the anomalous kidney becomes infected, is obstructed by calculus, or has a neoplastic change. There is no indication for surgical intervention if the kidney functions normally. This report presents a case of CFRE in a 31-year-old male with recurrent right flank pain resulting from a large calculus in the upper moiety of the fused kidney. The calculus was surgically removed by percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The patient was discharged on analgesics, antibiotics, and potassium citrate tablets, with an order to follow up after one month. On follow-up, the patient's double-J (DJ) stent was removed and an X-ray was performed to rule out any complications. No signs of stones, strictures, or other complications were noticed.",Cureus,eng,2021,6.0
Retrograde ureteroscopic lithotripsy in cross-fused renal ectopia.,"Cross-fused renal ectopia is a rare congenital malformation, and few cases of urolithiasis have been treated by retrograde ureteroscopic lithotripsy.

Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with reversed chimney graft technique in a patient with crossed fused renal ectopia: a technical note.,Crossed fused renal ectopia is a very rare congenital ectopia and poses great challenges when performing abdominal aortic surgery because of the accompanying abnormal vessels and urinary tracts. A 79-year-old woman with an abdominal aortic aneurysm and L-shaped crossed fused renal ectopia was referred to our facility. One of the large ectopic renal arteries arose from the right common iliac artery. The aneurysm was treated with an endovascular aortic repair. The reversed chimney graft technique was applied to preserve the ectopic renal artery while elongating the distal landing zone on the right side. The patient experienced no complications such as renal dysfunction or recurrence of the abdominal aortic aneurysm during the 6-month follow-up period.,Journal of surgical case reports,eng,2021,6.0
Recurrent formation of haematocolpos in a young girl with multiple congenital anomalies of the urogenital tract.,"An 11-year-old girl, a known case of left crossed fused renal ectopia and sacral hypoplasia presented to the gynaecological OPD in Karachi, Pakistan, in February 2019 with complaints of abdominal pain. On examination, she was found to have a septum covering her vaginal orifice. She was subsequently diagnosed with haematocolpos secondary to imperforate hymen. Incision and drainage was done. However, despite surgical management, she continued to have recurrent formation of haematocolpos for the next two months secondary to multiple complete and partial transverse vaginal septa and post-operative formation of adhesions. Definitive management was done with ultrasound guided needle puncture and drainage, followed by post-operative tampon use to maintain patency.",JPMA.

Left-to-right crossed fused renal ectopia with pyelonephritis mimicking appendix mass.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is an uncommon developmental anomaly of the genitourinary system whereby the two kidneys are located on the same side of the body and joined together, while the ureter of the ectopic kidney still enters the bladder in its normal side. CFRE has variable clinical presentations and usually discovered incidentally when patients are investigated for abdominal complaints. Treatment may be conservative when renal function is preserved with no associated symptomatic urological complications. Highlighted here is the unusual presentation of left-to-right CFRE with acute pyelonephritis as an appendix mass in a 19-year-old female.",Urology annals,eng,2021,
Klippel Feil syndrome with crossed fused renal ectopia with pelviureteric junction obstruction: A rare association.,"An 11-year-old female patient presented with congenital spinal deformity with a history of occasional pain in the right flank for a duration of six months. On evaluation, she was diagnosed to be a case of type III Klippel Feil syndrome (KFS) with crossed fused renal ectopia (left to right) and pelviureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) of the right moiety. The patient underwent successful pyeloplasty of the right moeity.

Minimally Invasive Approaches for Stone Clearance in Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is a rare fusion anomaly of the kidneys, with a predisposition to calculus disease. Management of renal calculi in CFRE is not standardized because of paucity of literature. We managed a 32-year-old man with left to right CFRE with multiple stones in both the kidneys by percutaneous nephrolithotomy for the right moiety and laparoscopic pyelolithotomy for the crossed moiety. Based on the stone burden and anatomy, we decided to go for a staged approach, to provide maximum clearance rate with least risk. We share our experience in this case, with regard to the use of two different but minimally invasive modalities for effective management of the patient. We also emphasize on the utilization of a staged approach whenever required for patient safety. We also reviewed the literature regarding the management of kidney stones in this rare anomaly.",Journal of endourology case reports,eng,2020,
Open pyelolithotomy in an ectopic kidney: A case report.,"Renal ectopia with stone is a rare case with no specific reported incidence rate. The treatment of kidney stone in ectopic kidneys poses a challenge to urologists. A 48-year-old male presenting with colicky pain on the right flank since one year ago. CT urography revealed an right-crossed renal ectopia and hyperdense lesions (25 × 20 mm and 10 × 10 mm) in the ureteropelvic junction of the right kidney. Under general anesthesia, we performed open pyelolithotomy for the patient and removed two stones completely. Open surgery could be the choice for patients with complex stone burden and associated renal anomalies such as ectopic kidney.",Urology case reports,eng,2021,3.0

Against the Odds: Management of Ureteral Calculus in Patient With Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is a rare congenital abnormality of the urinary tract where the kidneys are fused on one side, while the ureter of the ectopic kidney crosses the midline with the normal entrance in the bladder on the contralateral side. Congenital anomalies are associated with a stone formation whose management represents a real challenge. To our knowledge, we report the second case of CFRE associated with ureteral stone, which has been successfully resolved with Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL) and the first of its kind where a sufficient degree of stone disintegration has been achieved after a single session with a complete stone clearance during the follow-up. Radiological examination showed an inferior type of CFRE with stone in the proximal part of the ureter of the upper kidney. ESWL is an acceptable and effective treatment option in CFRE patients due to the minimally invasive approach, potentially high stone-free rate, and rare complications.",Cureus,eng,2020,10.0
Coexistence of a rare type of ectopic kidney with atypical renal vasculature.,"Knowledge of anatomical anomalies is significant for all specialists in clinical practice and may prevent serious complications following medical procedures. This report presents the rare crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) with atypical renal vasculature in cadaver of a 68-year-old man. The ectopic kidney was located on right side with four renal veins, three renal arteries, two ureters, where one of them is double. The embryological background, as well as the potential clinical significance of this morphological variation, is discussed. An interventional radiological and surgical procedure should be appropriately implemented to treat anomalies of vessels and CFRE.",Anatomical science international,eng,2021,3.0
Embolization of an angiomyolipoma in a crossed fused renal ectopia.,"Crossed fused ectopic kidney represents a rare congenital malformation, and development of an angiomyolipoma (AML) in a crossed fused ectopia is even rarer. There is no clear association between both entities. However, approximately half of crossed fused renal ectopic patients may develop infections, obstruction and/or nephrolithiasis. Nevertheless, they are very rarely associated with carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of AML in crossed fused renal ectopia. In this report, we present a patient with a left renal angiomyolipoma in a crossed fused renal ectopia managed by embolization. In addition, a literature review for relevant cases will be provided.",Urology case reports,eng,2020,11.0

Incidentally detected pancake kidney: a case report.,"Congenital anomalies of the urinary system are very common and have extremely varied presentation. Among them, the most rarely found structural anomaly is the pancake kidney. When both kidneys are fused along their medial surfaces to form a round-shaped single renal mass, it is termed as pancake kidney. In this case report, a pancake kidney was incidentally detected in a girl. The majority of individuals who have pancake kidney are usually asymptomatic but surgeons should be aware of coexisting malformation of other organs and its potential risk of developing malignancy.",Journal of medical case reports,eng,2020,8.0
Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy in a Patient with Cross-Fused Renal Ectopia.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Cross-fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is a rare congenital anomaly in which an ectopic kidney crosses the midline and merges with the orthotopic kidney on the other side. Patients with CFRE could present with urolithiasis. The abnormal anatomy and the lack of consensus to treat urolithiasis in these cases present challenges to treatment. In this study, we present a case of renal stone in a CFRE managed through percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). <b><i>Case Presentation:</i></b> We present a case of a 59-year-old man with right flank pain. Radiologic studies showed a 2 cm renal pelvis stone in a CFRE. The patient was effectively managed with PCNL. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> With proper radiologic study and thorough understanding of the aberrant anatomy, PCNL represents a safe and effective treatment for patients with renal stones in CFRE with high stone-free rate and low mortality.",Journal of endourology case reports,eng,2020,
Rare heterozygous GDF6 variants in patients with renal anomalies.,"Although over 50 genes are known to cause renal malformation if mutated, the underlying genetic basis, most easily identified in syndromic cases, remains unsolved in most patients. In search of novel causative genes, whole-exome sequencing in a patient with renal, i.e., crossed fused renal ectopia, and extrarenal, i.e., skeletal, eye, and ear, malformations yielded a rare heterozygous variant in the GDF6 gene encoding growth differentiation factor 6, a member of the BMP family of ligands. Previously, GDF6 variants were reported to cause pleiotropic defects including skeletal, e.g., vertebral, carpal, tarsal fusions, and ocular, e.g., microphthalmia and coloboma, phenotypes. To assess the role of GDF6 in the pathogenesis of renal malformation, we performed targeted sequencing in 193 further patients identifying rare GDF6 variants in two cases with kidney hypodysplasia and extrarenal manifestations. During development, gdf6 was expressed in the pronephric tubule of Xenopus laevis, and Gdf6 expression was observed in the ureteric tree of the murine kidney by RNA in situ hybridization. CRISPR/Cas9-derived knockout of Gdf6 attenuated migration of murine IMCD3 cells, an effect rescued by expression of wild-type but not mutant GDF6, indicating affected variant function regarding a fundamental developmental process. Knockdown of gdf6 in Xenopus laevis resulted in impaired pronephros development. Altogether, we identified rare heterozygous GDF6 variants in 1.6% of all renal anomaly patients and 5.4% of renal anomaly patients additionally manifesting skeletal, ocular, or auricular abnormalities, adding renal hypodysplasia and fusion to the phenotype spectrum of GDF6 variant carriers and suggesting an involvement of GDF6 in nephrogenesis.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,eng,2020,12.0
Lessons for the clinical nephrologist: a rare case of unfused renal ectopia.,"Right crossed inferior unfused renal ectopia is a rare developmental anomaly in which both kidneys are located on the left side of the body. It's the result of a halt in migration of kidneys to their normal location during the embryonic period and in ureteral bud faulty that migrates to the opposite side and induces the metanephric blastema on the wrong side. In this article, we aim to review embryology and complete description of renal ectopia anatomy and describe a rare case of right crossed unfused inferior renal ectopia with a left lower kidney artery originated directly from an abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA). The treatment consisted in AAA's exclusion with a custom-made endograft device shaped on purpose with a dedicated branch allowing perfusion of the ectopic lower left kidney.",Journal of nephrology,eng,2021,2.0
Nephroureterectomy of Right-to-Left Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia with Urothelial Carcinoma.,"Urothelial carcinoma in a crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is an exceedingly rare clinical finding. We describe the surgical management used to treat upper tract urothelial carcinoma in a 64-year-old man with a right-to-left CFRE. Nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision was the treatment of choice. The fused kidney was carefully dissected until an area of demarcation emerged between the vasculature supplying the left and right moieties. Pressure was applied to the isthmus separating the two moieties, and a sharp incision was made to release the left moiety. The operation was completed with limited blood loss. Pathology revealed a high-grade T3 papillary urothelial carcinoma with negative margins. To our knowledge, the case is the first to report urothelial carcinoma in a right-to-left CFRE.",Cureus,eng,2020,6.0
Grade IV Renal Laceration in a 13-Year-Old Boy With Cross-fused Renal Ectopia.,"A 13-year-old boy presented with gross hematuria following a skateboarding accident and was found to have cross-fused renal ectopia of the left kidney with a grade IV right renal laceration and urinary extravasation. Despite a double-J ureteral stent, urinoma drain, and indwelling bladder catheter, his urinoma drain maintained high output. He underwent a ureteral stent exchange and upsizing. A percutaneous nephrostomy tube was subsequently placed for maximal urinary diversion, which ultimately led to the resolution in his urinary leak. This case highlights our endourologic approach to manage a severe urinary leak despite conservative measures in a pediatric patient with a renal anomaly.",Urology,eng,2020,11.0
Crossed Renal Ectopia with a Fused Supernumerary Kidney.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia and the presence of a supernumerary kidney are both rare congenital variants that are often asymptomatic but may be associated with other developmental anomalies. Here we present a case of a 20-year-old male with a known diagnosis of crossed fused renal ectopia as well as a history of imperforate anus and tethered spinal cord treated in infancy. He presented to the emergency room with symptoms of flank pain, and a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 4-mm stone in the distal left ureter. CT scan also revealed that the patient's right kidney was not crossed and fused to the left kidney as previously believed, but rather it was crossed and fused to a supernumerary kidney abutting the inferomedial aspect of an orthotopic left kidney. This is a unique example of two rare coexisting renal anomalies not previously detected on a nuclear medicine renal scan and serial renal ultrasounds obtained earlier in the the patient's life.",Cureus,eng,2020,4.0
Case Report of a Pelvic Crossed Fused Renal Ectopic Kidney.,"Herein we present a case of a horseshoe kidney with crossed fused renal ectopia. Both of these pathologies are congenital anomalies; however, to date, there are few cases that present with both. In this case, discovered during routine dissection, the fused kidney was mostly left-sided and very low in the pelvis. No renal artery arose from the right wall of the abdominal aorta, and the right renal vein drained into the lower part of the inferior vena cava (IVC) where the right and left common iliac veins joined. It is essential for clinicians and surgeons to understand these types of congenital anomalies, as they could impact patient care.",The Kurume medical journal,eng,2020,7.0

Pelvic ectopic solitary kidney: treatment with the application of three-dimensional computed tomography and laparoscopic pyeloplasty-a case report.,"Renal ectopia occurs in 1:3,000-1:7,000 children. Simple ectopia refers to the abnormal kidney location on the same side; in crossed ectopia the ureter crosses the midline of the body. Pelvic ectopic solitary kidney with hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is even rarer in clinical practice. We report a case of a pelvic ectopic solitary kidney with hydronephrosis due to UPJO in an 18-year-old girl. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan showed the Single Ectopic Kidney with irregular shape lying in the pelvis and its cortex is very thin because of the grossly dilated renal pelvis and ureter. The terminal ureteral joined the right posterior wall of bladder. The renal artery originated from the bilateral common iliac artery, and laparoscopic pyeloplasty was performed. 18 months after the surgery, hydronephrosis was improved morphologically, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was stable.",Translational andrology and urology,eng,2019,12.0

Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia with Single Ureter and Single Renal Vein: A Rare Case.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia with a single ureter and single renal vein is a rare congenital anomaly in which both the fused kidneys lie on one side of the body. We present an unusual case of crossed fused renal ectopia with a single ureter, single renal vein, and a calculus in a 22-year-old man who presented with lower abdominal pain, burning micturition, and a right-side abdominal lump present for three months. On abdominal ultrasound and non-contrast computed tomography (CT), the left kidney was not visualized in the left renal fossa. However, we noted it on the right side, fused to the lower pole of the right kidney with a calculus within the pelvis leading to mild hydronephrosis. After intravenous administration of non-ionic contrast medium, we saw a single ureter draining both the moieties into the urinary bladder on the right side. A three-dimensional volume rendering technique revealed a single renal vein draining the renal parenchyma into the inferior vena cava. Cross fused renal ectopia is an uncommon congenital anomaly which remains asymptomatic throughout life and undetected in the absence of renal pathologies. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) is an excellent tool for denoting anatomical details of this anomaly; the information provided by MDCT is crucial for surgeons, nephrologists, and radiologists alike in facilitating proper management of the condition.",Cureus,eng,2019,1.0

"Pancake kidney, a rare and often misdiagnosed malformation: a case report and radiological differential diagnosis.","Renal ectopia and fusion anomalies are Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and the Urinary Tract (CAKUT) that are usually incidentally detected and asymptomatic. Patients affected present a higher risk of complications like recurrent urinary tract infections or obstruction. Pancake kidney (PK) is one of the rarest types of renal anomaly with complete fusion of the superior, mild and inferior poles of both kidneys in the pelvic cavity. Each kidney has its own excretory system with two ureters that do not cross the midline. In the asymptomatic cases, a conservative approach should be performed. Surgical management may be needed when urological problems occur. PK is often associated with congenital anomalies of other organs. Ultrasound is the first line radiological examination for the diagnosis and the follow-up of kidney malformations. The main sonographic findings suggesting PK diagnosis are a large and lobulated renal mass consisting of two fused lateral lobes without an intervening septum located in the pelvic cavity. Each lobe usually has a separate pelvicalyceal system, the renal pelvis is anteriorly placed and the ureters are usually short and enter the bladder normally without crosses the midline. Ultrasonography gives useful information on the morphology and volume of the organ, and on its vascularization through the use of the Color- and Power-Doppler. Computer Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Urography are second level techniques used to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate the presence of other abnormalities. The knowledge of the imaging findings and the anatomy of congenital renal malformations is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and misinterpretations. We report the case of a 14-years old female with PK who was misdiagnosed with a horseshoe kidney (HSK) during an abdominal ultrasound.",Journal of ultrasound,eng,2019,6.0

Crossed Fused Ectopic Kidney: A Case Report.,"Crossed fused ectopic kidney is an unusual congenital malformation of the urinary tract. This condition is usually identified in the autopsy specimen rather than in general clinical scenario. In this condition, both kidneys are located on one side of the midline and are fused with each other. This condition is generally asymptomatic and usually diagnosed as incidental finding. We came across a case of crossed fused left to right ectopia with inferior infusion with nephroptosis. Generally, in cases of crossed fused renal ectopia, one kidney is lower than the other one but in our report, both kidneys were present at the same level. Initially it was thought as cake kidney, but on careful inspection diagnosis of crossed fused left to right ectopia with inferior infusion was made. During workup of abdominal pain, this finding was detected with no gross abnormality except for a tiny calculus. After detailed discussion with the patient, regular follow up was done without any active intervention and during that period he remained clinically and radiologically stable. So in these conditions active intervention is not always mandatory and patient may remain asymptomatic without any intervention.",Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,eng,2017,8.0
Anatomical and Radiological Analyses of L-shaped Kidney with Vascular Anomalies.,"L-shaped kidney is a congenital anomaly.

Crossed nonfused renal ectopia with variant blood vessels: a rare congenital renal anomaly.,"Crossed renal ectopia is a rare congenital anomaly, where one of the kidneys crosses the midline and lies opposite to the site of its normal ureteral insertion. Ninety percent of crossed ectopic kidneys are fused to their ipsilateral uncrossed kidney. Crossed renal ectopia without fusion is rare. We present the case of a 53-year-old male with an unusual incidental finding of crossed nonfused renal ectopia, with the left ectopic kidney lying anterior to the right kidney without fusion. The ectopic kidney had dual arterial supply: one from the aorta and another from the right renal artery. It also demonstrated dual venous drainage; a main left renal vein and an accessory renal vein. The main left renal vein joined the right renal vein to form a common renal vein before draining into the inferior vena cava. The accessory renal vein joined the left testicular and left lumbar veins to drain into the inferior vena cava. Multiple bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi were also noted. Although the patient was asymptomatic, the authors highlight potential complications related to the above-mentioned condition and the importance of identification of the findings.",Radiology case reports,eng,2017,3.0

The baby was found to have bladder agenesis, a pelvic dysplastic horseshoe kidney, vertebral anomalies, a ventricular septal defect and facial dysmorphisms. It was surprising to find no abnormalities in amniotic fluid indices prenatally, suggesting the possibility of urine output that declined as the pregnancy proceeded. Some degree of twin-to-twin transfusion of amniotic fluid was also possible, which could have rescued the oligohydramnios known to be associated with kidney and urinary tract abnormalities. It was also notable that there was no abnormality in respiratory function, especially since further investigations revealed close to no kidney function. The intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) along with the multiple anomalies found made the baby unsuitable for dialysis and transplant, and the decision of transition to palliative care was made.",BMJ case reports,eng,2016,12.0
Double trouble: pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction and renal cell carcinoma in right to left crossed fused ectopia.,"Crossed renal ectopia is a rare occurrence. The majority of the crossed units are fused to their ipsilateral mate. Pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) in crossed fused moieties has been reported very rarely. Similarly, malignancy arising in the crossed over moieties is a rare occurrence too. Only a few cases have been reported earlier. We are here reporting an unusual case with coexistent PUJO and renal cell carcinoma in the crossed over moiety of right to left crossed fused ectopia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case with both these pathologies, coexisting, in the crossed over moiety. The patient underwent open radical nephrectomy of the right moiety via a lower midline incision. Surgery in this scenario is very challenging due to complex anatomy with aberrant vasculature, which needs for dissection within the renal parenchyma, similar to nephron-sparing surgery to separate from the normal moiety.",BMJ case reports,eng,2016,12.0

SUCCESSFUL REPAIR OF IATROGENIC URETERAL INJURY IN A PATIENT WITH ECTOPIC CROSSED AND FUSED RIGHT KIDNEY BY URETEROURETEROSTOMY.,"Congenital renal malformations are the most common congenital malformations in humans, the most common being horseshoe kidney with joined lower poles present in up to 0.25% of general population. To the contrary renal fusions with ectopia are amongst the rare malformations affecting 1 in 2000 examined cadavers. Males are affected slightly more often then females (3:2), left to right crosses being more frequent. The value of early diagnosis of asymptomatic renal malformation is uncertain, except when other abnormalities might point to them and they can affect the clinical management strategy (severe ear deformity with facial malformation, gynecological abnormalities). In females concomitant abnormalities of kidneys and paramesonephric duct derivatives are common, with up to 40% of women with uterine malformations reported to have various congenital renal abnormalities. Even though there are occasional examples of surgical repair of the injured kidneys with crossed-fused malformation the majority of surgical cases resort to renal resection. We presented a rare case of complex genitourinary malformation with crossed fused disk kidney diagnosed after the iatrogenic injury to the right ureter after emergent gynecological surgery. Rare pathology and presentation was diagnosed by IVP and confirmed during operation. We have constructed an ipsilateral ureteroureterostomy to drain the right portion of fused kidney. Urinary flow was satisfactory with no significant nephrostomy tube drainage next day, allowing the nephrostomy tube removal. Postsurgical evaluation by IVP has demonstrated a good flow from both kidney and no detectable anastomotic leaks. Postsurgical recovery was uneventful. After 2 years from operation IVP data did not changed. It must be noted, that Ectopic kidneys are frequently malformed and have an abnormal ureteral drainage leading to incontinence and frequent UTIs.",Georgian medical news,eng,2016,7.0

In her medical history, she had a cleft palate, hip dislocation and crossed renal ectopia. Dysmorphological evaluation revealed a triangular face, low-set ears, fissured cleft tongue, micrognathia, proximally placed hypoplastic thumbs, genu valgus, 2-3 toe skin syndactyly, clinodactyly and nail hypoplasia. Speech problems were also noticed. The karyotype was normal. Subtelomeric fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis showed a de novo terminal deletion about 755 kb. Furthermore, the breakpoint was located within the CHSY1 gene that is responsible for Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome which shares clinical features with 15qter deletion syndrome.

Right lump kidney with varied vasculature and urinary system revealed by multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) angiography.,"Renal ectopia also known as ectopic kidney is an embryological renal anomaly characterised by abnormal anatomical location of one or both of the kidneys. This can occur in various forms such as (1) crossed fused renal ectopia, (2) ectopic thoracic kidney and (3) pelvic kidneys. The lump kidney is one of the six variations of crossed fused ectopic kidney. Throughout life, the patient may remain asymptomatic, however, symptomatic patients may present with minor traumatic injuries due to the abnormal location or normal kidney pathologies. During normal embryological development, there is cephalic migration during which the kidneys ascend to their normal retroperitoneal location; therefore, an ectopic location is as a result of arrested migration. During this embryological development the kidney has multiple aorto-illiac branches, which degenerate when the kidney reaches its normal location. Here they develop new renal branches from the aorta and during an arrested ascent the ectopic kidney tends to retain some of the older aorto-iliac vessels. Hence, the arterial supply and the veineux drainage are grossly abnormal, reflecting the metanephric malascent and the primitive vascular arrangement. The collecting systems also present with important anatomical variations. We present an extremely rare case of right lump kidney with six renal arteries, two renal veins and two duplicated pelvicalyceal systems.",Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,eng,2015,9.0

Management of an iatrogenic injury in a crossed ectopic kidney without fusion.,"Crossed renal ectopia is a condition in which a kidney is located on the side opposite of its ureteral insertion. Ninety percent of crossed ectopic kidneys are fused to their ipsilateral uncrossed renal unit. Crossed renal ectopia without fusion is rare, with only 62 patients reported in the literature to date. These kidneys may suffer iatrogenic injury during an unrelated surgical intervention. The injury, unless self-limiting, may necessitate the removal of the ectopic kidney. We present a unique case of a dual injury, renal as well as ureteric, in a crossed ectopic kidney without fusion that was successfully managed without surgical excision.",Korean journal of urology,eng,2014,8.0
Ectopic ureter presenting as anterior wall vaginal prolapse.,"The differential diagnoses for anterior wall vaginal prolapse (AWVP) include cystocele, enterocele, urethral diverticulum, and Gartner duct cyst. We present a case of a patient with a known solitary right kidney (congenital absence of a left kidney) presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms, absence of urinary incontinence, and feeling of bulge in the vagina. Physical examination revealed grade II AWVP. Because congenital solitary kidney can be associated with other possible genitourinary abnormalities, a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging was obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a tubular structure spanning the left retroperitoneum to the region of the AWVP. Urodynamics revealed an obstructive voiding pattern during pressure-flow phase. The combination of transvaginal and transabdominal surgical excision of the tubular structure resolved the patient's lower urinary tract and prolapse symptoms. Anatomically, her AWVP was corrected. Histopathologic examination of the tubular structure revealed presence of urothelium lining the lumen of the tubular structure consistent with a ureter. This case represents the rare situation in which an ectopic ureter presented as an AWVP. However, patients with congenital solitary kidney presenting with vaginal prolapse should raise the suspicion for other associated genitourinary anomalies, whether these anomalies are related to the prolapse or not. Cross-sectional imaging should be performed in these situations to delineate precise anatomy.",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,eng,2014,
Crossed renal ectopia presenting with suprapubic swelling and acute renal failure.,"A 17-year-old male was admitted with a fluctuant suprapubic mass. A bladder scan demonstrated > 999 ml filling so he was catheterised. However, only 75ml of urine was drained. He was in acute renal failure with serum potassium of 6.5mmol/l. Computerised tomography (CT) scan showed a large midline 'cystic mass' separate from the bladder compressing the left ureter, causing left-sided hydronephrosis. Right kidney was not visualised. Percutaneous aspiration of the 'cyst' yielded 2000ml of straw-coloured fluid high in creatinine, urea and electrolytes indicating that it was urine. Having relieved the left ureter, the patient was subsequently diuresed, and renal function returned to normal. A CT urogram showed contrast uptake with renal parenchyma in the ""cyst"". Consequently, a diagnosis of right-sided crossed renal ectopia was made. Bilateral ureteric stents were inserted, and later a right-sided nephrectomy was performed. The patient made a full recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only reported case of crossed renal ectopia causing obstruction of the normal ureter, resulting in acute renal failure.The role of modern imaging in the management of this condition is also highlighted in this report.",JPMA.

"A case of VACTERL and non-VACTERL association without the ""V and L"".","VACTERL is a cluster of congenital malformations based on the non-random association of various congenital malformations in a single patient. Here ""V"" denotes vertebral defects or vascular anomalies (single umbilical artery), ""A"" anal atresia, ""C"" cardiac abnormalities, ""TE"" tracheoesophageal fistula, ""R""renal (kidney) abnormalities and ""L"" for limb anomalies) It is called an association, rather than a syndrome because the complications are not pathogenetically related, tend to occur more frequently than expected and are thought to be linked to embryonic mesodermal defects. Studies have reported the coexistence of various other congenital malformations such as respiratory, cerebral anomalies, which are frequently referred as non-VACTERL-type of associations. Diagnosis of VACTERL association is done only when at least three of the above mentioned congenital malformations are identified in a patient. Although 80% of these cases have vertebral defects, our case is unique as patient does not have one of the commonest occuring association i.e., vertebral anomalies, but has all other associations and an additional non VACTERL brain anomaly, hitherto unreported in the literature. The other highlight of this case is although reports say that VACTERL babies with ipsilateral renal disorder have the same side limb defects, our case has a renal anomaly with no limb anomaly. Finally VACTERL and non VACTERL association was considered in our patient in view of ventricular septal defect, tracheo esophageal fistula, anal atresia, renal anomaly, seizure disorder and global developmental delay due to pontocerebellar hypoplasia.","Indian journal of nuclear medicine : IJNM : the official journal of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, India",eng,2014,1.0

"Novel association of VACTERL, neural tube defect and crossed renal ectopia: sonic hedgehog signaling: a point of coherence?","The present case report describes two patients with a novel combination of VACTERL (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, limb), neural tube defect and crossed renal ectopia. Though cases of VACTERL associated with crossed renal ectopia have been described, the present case report is the first to describe its combination with neural tube defect. The cases reported here are significant because central nervous system manifestations are scarce in VACTERL syndrome. The role of sonic hedgehog pathway has been proposed in VACTERL association and neural tube defects.

Crossed renal ectopia coexisting with nephrolithiasis in a young Nigerian man.,"Renal ectopia or ectopic kidney is a congenital anomaly in which one or both kidneys are located in an unusual position. It results from the kidney failing to ascend properly from its origin in the true pelvis. In some cases, one kidney may cross over (crossed renal ectopia) so that both kidneys are on the same side of the body. When a crossover occurs, the two kidneys may grow together and become fused (crossed fused renal ectopia). Renal ectopia is generally uncommon; its coexistence with nephrolithiasis is even rarer.

Craniosynostosis and radial aplasia are striking features, easy to diagnose. However, there are many differential diagnoses. Often, the question raised is whether the Baller-Gerald syndrome is a distinct entity. We report a patient with findings of craniosynostosis and radial aplasia consistent with the diagnosis of the Baller-Gerold syndrome.

Crossed fused renal ectopia with segmental fusion of bilateral ureters and abdominal aortic anomalies in a patient with caudal regression syndrome.,"Caudal regression syndrome consists of multiple congenital anomalies, mainly caudal segment defects. We describe a preterm baby born to a healthy mother with typical caudal regression picture, including imperforated anus with rectovesical fistula, sacral agenesis, multiple rib and vertebral anomalies, and club feet. Crossed fused renal ectopia with fused ureters resulting in urinary obstruction was managed with transureteroureterostomy and cutaneous vesicostomy. We also found a single large umbilical artery with high abdominal aortic insertion which usually presents in sirenomelia.

Bilateral fused pelvic kidney ectopia with a single draining ureter solved by craniolateral displacement of the kidney and Boari-modified bladder-calyceal anastomosis with bladder augmentation.,"A pelvic cake kidney with hydronephrosis and renal failure with the single draining ureter was reported. Frequent urination related to compression of the bladder was the most important symptom. The kidney was craniolaterally displaced, the malfunctioning ureter was replaced with the Boari-like tubularization of the bladder, and the neoureter was anastomosed with the calyx.

Anatomy of successfully separated thoracopagus-omphalopagus conjoined twins.,"The birth of conjoined twins occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 deliveries, and the majority are either stillborn or die early in life. Approximately 184 successful separations have been described. The authors describe the preoperative radiologic evaluation of a set of thoracopagus-omphalopagus twins and their successful surgical separation. Preoperative radiologic imaging demonstrated that the twins did not share myocardium, but an ectopic cordis was present. The inferior vena cavae entered the right atria at more acute angles than normal. The liver was fused, two gallbladders were present, and there was a large bridging portal vein that crossed the hepatic isthmus of one twin to the conjoined twin's portal venous system. Replaced hepatic arteries originated from the superior mesenteric arteries. Each twin had separate kidneys, colons, and rectums. Preoperative tissue expansion was necessary, and the twins were separated at 5 1/2 months of life. Successful separation of twins conjoined by several organ systems requires a multispecialty approach. Preoperative knowledge of shared anatomy is necessary for adequate preparation and planning. Despite meticulous preoperative investigations, certain anatomy can only be discovered at the time of surgery, and the ability to adjust to these findings is imperative.","Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)",eng,2007,10.0

Crossed renal ectopia with fusion: report of two patients.,"Crossed renal ectopia is one of the rarest urinary system anomalies. It is more often seen at autopsy than in clinical practice. Most cases of renal ectopia remain asymptomatic during life and are diagnosed incidentally. Renal ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography, computerized tomography, and renal scintigraphy (technetium-based tests) are the imaging methods used for diagnosis. Demonstration of crossed renal ectopia is important because it is a predisposing factor for obstruction, infection, and neoplasia of the urinary system. We report two male patients who had unremarkable clinical findings. Both had left-to-right inferior crossed renal ectopia with fusion. Additionally, the first patient had a history of surgery for a recurrent inguinal hernia, whereas the second had crossed fused renal ectopia associated with nephroptosis. Surgeons should be aware of ectopic and fused kidneys to minimize perioperative complications because of the uncertain anatomy.","Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)",eng,2007,8.0
An unusual post-traumatic case of extrahepatic bile duct compression.,"Jaundice and cholestatic disease by external bile duct compression may be caused by several conditions, including pancreatic masses, portal cavernoma, Ormond's disease, metastases from gallbladder cancer, neurinomas, and hydronephrotic kidney. We report a case of bile duct compression in a 56-year-old man with a known small (28 mm) right renal cyst and crossed, fused renal ectopia. The patient had a history of recent abdominal trauma due to a motorcycle accident and recurrent septic-type fever and jaundice. He also reported a weight loss of 5 kg in the last two months. Abdominal ultrasonography showed intra- and extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation, and computed tomography scan showed hydronephrosis, dilatation of intra- and extra-hepatic biliary tract, and a right renal complex cyst of more than 9 cm. One can hypothesize a relationship between the abdominal trauma and the increase in size of the renal cyst, which, moreover, had changed its original shape. The patient underwent cefuroxime and metronidazole therapy, with complete recovery from the cholangitis within one week. The treatment of choice would have been surgical excision or, alternatively, an image-guided percutaneous aspiration of the cyst, in order to avoid further episodes of cholangitis. Unfortunately, the patient refused either surgical or more conservative treatment and was lost to follow-up.","The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",eng,2006,12.0

Robotic-assisted laparoscopic ureteroureterostomy in an adolescent with an obstructed upper pole system and crossed renal ectopia with fusion.,Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) in crossed renal ectopia with fusion is a rare condition. Management of UPJO occurring in ectopic kidneys generally requires open surgical reconstruction. Experience with minimally invasive techniques is minimal for repair of UPJO in ectopic kidneys.

Proximal ureteral ectopia causing hydronephrosis in a kitten.,"A 2-month-old, female cat was presented for abdomen dilation. The patient was undernourished, and severe left hydronephrosis was diagnosed after clinical, ultrasonographical and radiographical examination. Although pyelography was performed in order to visualise the ureteral course, surgery was necessary to reach a final aetiological diagnosis and treatment. At gross examination, the left ureter crossed the renal capsula at the level of the caudal renal pole, and the subcapsular ureteral segment was markedly dilated. Distal to the renal capsula, the left ureter was very thin when compared to the right. The parenchyma of the left kidney, as suggested by ultrasonographical evaluation, was extremely reduced in thickness. An ureteronephrectomy was performed. Histopathological evaluation revealed glomerular sclerosis and diffuse parenchymal fibrosis. Severe hydronephrosis derived from an altered renal pelvic anatomy and abnormal ureteral course determining functional stenosis. Diagnosis of congenital anomaly before development of complications such as hydronephrosis could have allowed a surgical renal capsulectomy and obstruction relief. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of severe hydronephrosis associated to altered renal pelvic anatomy and proximal ureteral ectopia in cat.",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,eng,2006,12.0

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in L-shaped kidneys: report of two cases.,"The L-shaped or tandem kidney is a type of crossed ectopia with fusion in which the crossed kidney assumes a transverse position during its attachment to the inferior pole of the other kidney. Calculus formation is a well-known sequel of congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract and we like to present two patients harbouring calculi in L-shaped kidneys treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). The first patient had a calculus in renal pelvis of the transverse kidney. The second case had multiple calculi in renal pelvis and calices of the vertically positioned kidney. After three sessions, first patient was stone free, whereas no fragmentation in the second case.

Aberrant vessels in ipsilateral malrotated kidney associated with contralateral cross ectopia without fusion.,"Aberrant vessels is the most common cause of extrinsic uretero-pelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. Due to the left flank pain, 18-year-old male patient with UPJ obstruction due to aberrant vessels in left malrotated kidney and right renal cross ectopia without fusion, had been operated. Ureter was reconstructed and anastomosed anterior to the aberrant vessels after the Double-J-Stent has been placed. At the postoperative period there were improvements in the clinical symptoms and renal function. So, even in the later childhood surgical choice is still the acceptable treatment modality in such cases. To the best of our knowledge, although there are some papers about aberrant vessels which cause UPJ obstruction, there is no such a case with ipsilateral renal hydronephrosis due to aberrant vessels associated with contralateral renal cross ectopia without fusion.",International urology and nephrology,eng,2005,

Further delineation of Hennekam syndrome.,"We report four children from four inbred Arab families with varying manifestations of Hennekam syndrome and additional features that have not been previously reported. These include abnormalities of the middle ear, anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, interrupted inferior vena cava, polysplenia, crossed renal ectopia, median position of the liver and multiple cavernous haemangiomas. In addition, in one case lymphoedema was absent and oedema due to hypoproteinaemia appeared at 6 years of age. Since anomalies of the veins and the consequent developmental abnormalities of the lymphatics might lead to alterations in the fluid balance of the embryo, we hypothesize that altered fluid dynamics due to defective vascular and lymphatic development might disrupt critical events in craniofacial morphogenesis resulting in Hennekam syndrome.",Clinical dysmorphology,eng,2003,10.0
Transitional cell carcinoma in a fused crossed ectopic kidney.,"Nephroureterectomy is considered the reference standard treatment for invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with crossed renal ectopia without fusion: case report and literature review.,"Genitourinary anomalies can present a formidable challenge to the vascular surgeon at abdominal aortic reconstruction. We saw a case of crossed renal ectopia without fusion, a rare anomaly, associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Because of risk for injury to the kidney during surgery, preoperative evaluation of this anomaly must include computed tomography, angiography, and intravenous pyelography. Preoperative placement of a ureteral catheter may prevent injury to the anomalous ureter. Renal failure of the ectopic kidney during aortic reconstruction can be a serious problem. We used in situ hypothermic perfusion with cold (4 degrees C) Ringer solution for renal protection, and reimplanted the aberrant renal artery. The postoperative course was good, without major complications. The procedure for renal preservation must be selected on the basis of anatomic findings. We review the literature and present the first case of crossed renal ectopia.",Journal of vascular surgery,eng,2003,5.0
"Molecular, biochemical, and phenotypic analysis of a hemizygous male with a severe atypical phenotype for X-linked dominant Conradi-Hunermann-Happle syndrome and a mutation in EBP.","X-linked dominant Conradi-Hunermann-Happle syndrome (CDPX2; MIM 302960) is a rare chondrodysplasia punctata primarily affecting females. CDPX2 is presumed lethal in males, although a few affected males have been reported. CDPX2 is a cholesterol biosynthetic disorder due to 3-beta-hydroxysteroid-delta8,delta7-isomerase deficiency caused by mutations in the emopamil binding protein (EBP) gene. A 2.5-year-old Caucasian male was followed from the age of 6 weeks and noted to have significant developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and patchy hypopigmentation. Multiple congenital anomalies included a unilateral cataract, esotropia, crossed renal ectopia, stenotic ear canals, and failure to thrive, requiring G-tube placement. Multiple minor anomalies and ptosis were noted. No skeletal asymmetry or chondrodysplasia punctata were noted on skeletal survey at 6 weeks and 13 months. An extensive genetic work-up including cholesterol (126-176 mg/dl) and 7-dehydrocholesterol was unrevealing. However, the levels of 8(9)-cholestenol and 8-dehydrocholesterol were mildly increased in plasma, which was confirmed in cultured fibroblasts. This prompted molecular analysis of the EBP gene, which revealed a novel hemizygous (nonmosaic) mutation in exon 2 (L18P). Two restriction digests were developed that confirmed this mutation in skin fibroblasts, blood, and buccal cells (all nonmosaic). We determined that the patient's mother (adopted) also has the L18P mutation enabling prenatal diagnosis of a normal male fetus. She has normal stature, no asymmetry, no cataracts at this time, and has a patch of hyperpigmentation on her chest best visualized on Woods lamp examination, characteristic of CDPX2. The mild maternal phenotype has been described previously. However, this nonmosaic missense mutation has resulted in a severe phenotype in her surviving son.",American journal of medical genetics.

Distal ureteral atresia associated with crossed renal ectopia with fusion: recovery of renal function after release of a 10-year ureteral obstruction.,"We report on a 10-year-old boy with distal ureteral atresia associated with crossed renal ectopia with fusion. He was admitted with a high fever associated with a urinary tract infection. The diagnosis was established by antegrade and retrograde pyelography. The upper hydronephrotic portion of the kidney, obstructed for 10 years, recovered its function after nephrostomy placement. To our knowledge, this is the first patient whose renal function has recovered despite an ureteral obstruction of 10-years' duration.

Crossed ureteral ectopia with an ectopic blind-ending ureter.,"A rare case of multiple urological anomalies is presented. The chief complaint of the patient, a 12-year-old girl, was urinary incontinence. Radiologic and endoscopic examinations revealed that the patient had a normal left kidney and ureter, a left ectopic blind-ending ureter that opened near the neck of the bladder, and right complete double ureters with an ectopic orifice that opened on the left of the external urethral meatus. This orifice was responsible for her urinary incontinence. Right ureteroneocystostomy was performed and the incontinence was cured. An attempt was made to explain the embryological origin of the anomalies observed in this case. We postulated that during development, on the left, there were three ureteral buds on the mesonephric duct. The first bud was at the normal position and drained the left kidney in a normal manner. The second bud was cranial from the normal position on the mesonephric duct and was associated with growth in an abnormal direction. This bud made contact with the upper portion of the right metanephric mass. The last bud grew between the two aforementioned buds. This bud was not draped by the metanephric mass and became the blind-ending ureter. On the right, one ureteral bud was located on the mesonephric duct and it made contact with a metanephric mass that became the right kidney. The upper part of the right kidney was drained by the ureter that had originally been located on the left mesonephric duct. This condition should be termed crossed ureteral ectopia rather than crossed renal ectopia, since the ureter was the structure that crossed.",Urologia internationalis,eng,1995,

The teratogenicity of cocaine has been widely investigated in the newborn. We report a case of crossed renal ectopia in a term neonate whose mother practiced alkaloid cocaine abuse in the first trimester of pregnancy. We propose that this anomaly was caused by cocaine's direct pharmacologic effect, leading to vasoconstriction that affected the developing fetal kidney by compromising the blood vessels that supply the organ or by causing hemorrhages and infarctions with fibrosis, causing disruption during a crucial period of morphogenesis.",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,eng,1994,

Crossed renal ectopia with pelvic lipomatosis: a new syndrome involving chromosome 1.,"An 18-year-old male patient is described who possesses both kidneys on one side (crossed renal ectopia), together with pelvic lipomatosis. In general, lipomatosis is benign, but here the tissue shows the rare feature of malignancy. Chromosomally, the patient is typically characterised by somatic translocations involving chromosome 1 (37% metaphases); these almost always exhibit a whole chromosome translocation with chromosome 6 (35%), although involvement of chromosome 1 with chromosome 8 is present in 2% of metaphases. Other chromosomal features encountered in Giemsa-stained and G-banded preparations from lymphocyte cultures include the prevalence of a small Y chromosome in 25% of metaphases, the presence of marker dots in 20%, and acrocentric associations in 8%-10% of metaphases. However, more than 50% of metaphases have a normal 46XY karyotype with a normal-sized Y-chromosome. Crossed renal ectopia with pelvic lipomatosis can therefore be assigned to a new syndrome characterised by a whole-chromosome translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 6.",Human genetics,eng,1992,8.0

Origin of abnormality in a human simelian foetus as elucidated by our knowledge of vertebrate development.,"In this paper we attempt to explain the abnormality of a simelian foetus with reference to our present knowledge of vertebrate development. The various developmental defects seem to have a single common origin: the speeding-up of the progression of cell differentiation in the notochord anlage--which is the organization centre of the embryo--during the regression of the Hensen's node. Cell activity involved in the morphogenetic movements in the chordamesoderm probably stopped before it should have. The elongation of the notochord anlage was not completed, resulting in the defective development of the posterior part of the foetus. A number of pairs of posterior trunk somites were not induced. Consequently (1) the pelvic limb buds, whose posterior parts were missing, fused, bringing in further developmental deviations in the limb skeleton and abdominal muscles; (2) there are no vertebrae between the first sacral vertebra and the misshaped coccyx formed by the tail bud. The derivatives of the posterior endoderm (hindgut, bladder and ureters) were not induced either. The cauda equina is deficient. The absence of functional kidneys and the presence of embryonic urinary tubules in the pelvic cysts which are wrapped up by gut epithelium suggest the induction of the metanephric mesenchyme by ectopic endoderm. The speeding-up of differentiation in the notochord anlage also probably resulted in the excessive extension of its anterior region which is the organizer of brain structures. This explains the overdevelopment of the nose and of the neurocranium, and the low position of the ear. A gene mutation as well as a mechanical stress are the possible causes of the abnormal behaviour of the notochord anlage.",Teratology,eng,1987,8.0
Multicystic dysplasia and crossed renal ectopia.,"Multicystic renal dysplasia in a crossed fused or nonfused ectopic kidney is a rare occurrence that produces unusual imaging findings. In four such cases in neonates, three presented with a palpable abdominal mass and one was discovered in utero with maternal sonography. In three cases, sonography showed a multicystic mass, contiguous with the lower pole of the orthotopic kidney. In the fourth infant, a crossed, tiny dysplastic kidney was not visualized, but its markedly dilated ectopic ureter was seen traversing the spine on CT. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction was present in the three fused orthotopic kidneys. The characteristic imaging findings of multicystic dysplasia and crossed renal ectopia include a multicystic mass of variable size that is contiguous with the lower pole of a hydronephrotic, malrotated kidney; ureteral displacement and/or dilatation; and contralateral absence of the kidney and its renal artery.",AJR.

A case report.","A man with crossed, non-fused renal ectopia had carcinoma of the distal ureter, leading to hydro-ureter, hydronephrosis and urinary infection. Crossed ectopic kidneys are more disease-prone than are normal kidneys. Complicating disorders are discussed, the value of thorough urologic investigation is stressed and the incidence of tumour of the upper urinary tract in crossed renal ectopia without fusion is reviewed.",Scandinavian journal of urology and nephrology,eng,1979,

"Probable endometrial carcinoma of the prostate, crossed renal ectopia and dermatomyositis in a 32-year-old man.","An unusual type of prostatic carcinoma associated with crossed renal ectopia and dermatomyositis is reported in a young man. Infiltration by an epithelial tumor filled the enlarged prostate with soft papillary masses. Cystoprostatectomy and removal of a single large pelvic lymph node metastasis were done. Histologically, the tumor resembled endometrial carcinoma and may have arisen from paramesonephric tissue in the prostate. Large amounts of immunoglobulins were found in the tumor tissue. The patient has survived for more than 5 years, although a slow growing urethral recurrence has been noted.",The Journal of urology,eng,1978,10.0
Solitary crossed renal ectopia and its associated congenital anomalies.,"Solitary crossed renal ectopia is one of the rarest congenital renal anomalies, with only 21 previously reported cases. It is often accompanied by multisystem congenital anomalies, mainly skeletal and genital in type. The twenty-second such case of this rare congenital anomaly is reported in association with a severe congenital scoliosis of the lumbosacral spine. The embryogenesis and the significance of its associated congenital anomalies are discussed.",The Journal of urology,eng,1978,8.0
Crossed fused renal ectopia presenting with blunt trauma.,A case is presented of crossed fused renal ectopia in a fifteen-year-old black male which was diagnosed because of blunt trauma. Workup and management are discussed and pertinent x-ray films shown. The literature is reviewed with respect to renal trauma associated with congenital anomalies of the kidney.,Urology,eng,1978,7.0
Crossed renal ectopia with familial occurrence.,A familial occurrence of crossed renal ectopia is presented. No genetic factor has been determined in this congenital anomaly so this familial occurrence is believed to be incidental.,Urology,eng,1978,7.0

Crossed renal ectopia and abdominal aortic aneurysm.,A case of crossed renal ectopia assoicated with abdominal aortic aneurysm is reported. This is believed to be the first known case of these entities occurring together. It is important for the urologist to be cognizant of the possibility of such an association so that appropriate surgical correction of the aneurysm may be carried out without undue delay. The importance of a preoperative intravenous pyelogram for all patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is stressed.,Urology,eng,1977,12.0

Struvite staghorn calculi in crossed fused ectopia.,Two patients with a struvite staghorn calculus in crossed fused renal ectopia are described. The susceptibility of these patients to urinary tract infection is discussed as is the anomalous extrarenal arterial vasculature to the ectopic and non-ectopic kidneys. Both patients were treated successfully with anatrophic nephrolithotomy and each has remained free of recurrent calculous disease to date.,The Journal of urology,eng,1977,9.0
A unique combination of congenital genitourinary anomalies in a child.,"A case of solitary crossed renal ectopia with concomitant, severe vesicoureteral reflux and a rudimentary ipsilateral ectopic ureter draining into the vas deferens is presented. In addition to these anomalies the patient had complete urethral duplication and right cryptorchidism, as well as right congenital dislocation of the hip. To our knowledge this is the first such case to be documented in the medical literature.",The Journal of urology,eng,1977,8.0
Wilms' tumor in crossed fused renal ectopia.,The occurrence of a nephroblastoma in a crossed ectopic kidney has been reported only one previous time. A second patient with these findings is the subject of this report.,Journal of pediatric surgery,eng,1977,8.0
"Crossed, fused renal ectopia with severe hydronephrosis: angiographic diagnosis.","The authors describe two children with crossed, fused renal ectopia in whom severely damaged hydronephrotic ectopic kidneys were not shown by intravenous urography. Aortography confirmed the diagnosis in both patients. Aortography is of great value if a diseased ectopic kidney must be resected; demonstration of the vascular supply to both kidneys enables the surgeon to preserve all of the normal renal tissue.",Journal of the Canadian Association of Radiologists,eng,1977,6.0

"Crossed ectopia of seminal vesicles, renal aplasia and ectopic ureter.","A unique case of left ureteral opening into a seminal vesicle, ipsilateral renal hyperplasia and crossed ectopia of the seminal vesicles is reported. This 24-year-old white man underwent a nephroureterectomy for relief of symptoms of lower urinary tract infection. The embryological development of this abnormality is discussed briefly.",The Journal of urology,eng,1976,6.0
Crossed renal ectopia with colic. A clinical clue to embryogenesis.,"A clinicopathologic correlation of 2 patients with crossed renal ectopia presenting with ureteric colic and 4 cases collected from the literature is presented. The correlation serves to reaffirm the theory of ureteral and not renal, migration as the primary aberration resulting in this defect.",British journal of urology,eng,1976,6.0
Crossed renal ectopia in children.,"Nine children were treated with crossed fused renal ectopia, and in 8 there were serious other urinary tract malformations which were surgically correctable. The finding of crossed fused renal ectopia warrants complete urologic investigation including cystogram and cystoscopy to rule out surgically correctable pathology in the urinary tract.",Urology,eng,1976,2.0
