### Introduction

Renal ectopic variations are congenital anomalies characterized by a kidney's location outside of its typical position in the renal fossa. Understanding these variations is pivotal in clinical management, especially in contexts of surgeries, interventions, and diagnostic evaluations. This paper presents a unique variant of renal ectopia, offering insight into the broader landscape of such anomalies.

### Case Presentation

A 61-year-old patient with DOB 09-03-1962 presented for evaluation. Lab tests were all within normal limits. The indication was a pelvic kidney and dilated right ureteric, for which further evaluation was sought. Comparison was made with an MRI of the prostate dated 9/11/2022 and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated 29/11/2010.

Key findings from the evaluation included:

- Empty renal beds with the right kidney located in the right pelvic fossa.
- Crossed fused left renal ectopia was observed.
- Both kidneys were slightly smaller than typical, with no evident solid or cystic lesions.
- A dilated right ureter with layering calcifications, and an occluded right UVJ.
- Bilateral renal arteries arising from the common iliac arteries.
- A unique fusion pattern between the upper pole of the right kidney and the middle pole of the left kidney. 

### Discussion

The presented case showcases a renal ectopic variant not fully encompassed by current classification subtypes. Elements from the L-shaped and Superior ectopia subtypes are evident. However, the distinct fusion pattern and the single functional fused ureter highlight a variation that necessitates its classification consideration. Recognizing such cases is essential for apt clinical management and might require re-evaluation or augmentation of existing classification systems.
