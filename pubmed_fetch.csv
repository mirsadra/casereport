Recurrent urinary tract infections led to the diagnosis of cross-renal ectopia: A case report.,"Crossed renal ectopy (CRE) is a very rare congenital kidney anomaly. CRE is usually asymptomatic and is most often discovered incidentally, but the patient may sometimes develop various renal manifestations.",International journal of surgery case reports,eng,2023,08
A Rare Case of Crossed Non-fused Ectopic Kidney.,"Crossed and non-fused kidneys are an exceedingly rare congenital anomaly in which one or both kidneys cross the midline to the opposite side. At the same time, the ureters are inserted in their normal anatomical locations in the bladder. Although crossed ectopic kidneys are mostly asymptomatic and incidentally discovered during workup for other disorders, they are prone to urological complications such as urinary tract infections (UTIs). Here we present the case of a 12-year-old male with a history of recurrent UTIs and urinary retention who presented to the emergency department with recurrent UTIs and urinary retention and was eventually found to have an ectopic unfused left kidney in the right lumbar region on computed tomography (CT).",Cureus,eng,2022,11

Obstructed hemivagina with ipsilateral renal and urinary tract anomaly presenting as an unusual cause of acute abdomen: a radiologic perspective.,"Obstructed hemivagina with ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) is a rare congenital genitourinary defect with a triad of unilateral vaginal obstruction, uterine anomaly and ipsilateral renal agenesis. This paper reports an unusual presentation of OHVIRA, with our patient experiencing severe abdominal pain from a left tubo-ovarian abscess that is contralateral to the side of the vaginal outflow obstruction. Another reportable finding is our patient's rare association of a trifid ureter that fuses distally before inserting ectopically in her vaginal canal. Lastly, this case report also emphasises the importance of radiologists' expertise in suspecting the diagnosis early on and in contributing to the preoperative evaluation of patients with OHVIRA, thereby providing adequate management for these patients.",BMJ case reports,eng,2022,06
Bilateral ureteral reimplantation in a patient with an intraperitoneal ectopic bipenis: A case report.,"Diphallia is a highly uncommon congenital urogenital abnormality and a few connected reports have been published. However, no case of intraabdominal heterotopic diphallus has been documented to date. In the present study, we present a rare case of intraperitoneal ectopic bipenis.",World journal of clinical cases,eng,2022,03
Crossed fused renal ectopia (pancake type) with single ureter: A case report.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia is a rare congenital anomaly of renal embryogenesis. The majority of such anomalous kidneys are supplied by a single renal artery and drained by two separate ureters. However, drainage by a single common ureter is an unusual variant. Here, we present a 17-year old male with a pelvic pancake kidney drained by a single ureter with associated acute obstructive uropathy diagnosed with ultrasonography and computed tomography urography (CTU). We describe the anatomical peculiarity and diagnostic evaluation of the case.",Urology case reports,eng,2021,11
Left-to-right crossed fused renal ectopia with pyelonephritis mimicking appendix mass.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is an uncommon developmental anomaly of the genitourinary system whereby the two kidneys are located on the same side of the body and joined together, while the ureter of the ectopic kidney still enters the bladder in its normal side. CFRE has variable clinical presentations and usually discovered incidentally when patients are investigated for abdominal complaints. Treatment may be conservative when renal function is preserved with no associated symptomatic urological complications. Highlighted here is the unusual presentation of left-to-right CFRE with acute pyelonephritis as an appendix mass in a 19-year-old female.",Urology annals,eng,2021,
Klippel Feil syndrome with crossed fused renal ectopia with pelviureteric junction obstruction: A rare association.,"An 11-year-old female patient presented with congenital spinal deformity with a history of occasional pain in the right flank for a duration of six months. On evaluation, she was diagnosed to be a case of type III Klippel Feil syndrome (KFS) with crossed fused renal ectopia (left to right) and pelviureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) of the right moiety. The patient underwent successful pyeloplasty of the right moeity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the literature with a combination of KFS, crossed fused renal ectopia, and PUJO.","Medical journal, Armed Forces India",eng,2021,04
Crossed unfused renal ectopia with pelviureteric junction obstruction associated with nephrolithiasis: a rare troublesome triad managed by robotic surgery.,We report a rare case of non-fused renal ectopia with pelviureteric junction obstruction and multiple pelvic and renal calculi thereby discussing vascular anatomy of the non-fused ectopic kidney along with robot assisted surgical management of this rare clinical entity which amounts for good preoperative workup for best surgical and clinical outcome.,BMJ case reports,eng,2021,04
Against the Odds: Management of Ureteral Calculus in Patient With Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is a rare congenital abnormality of the urinary tract where the kidneys are fused on one side, while the ureter of the ectopic kidney crosses the midline with the normal entrance in the bladder on the contralateral side. Congenital anomalies are associated with a stone formation whose management represents a real challenge. To our knowledge, we report the second case of CFRE associated with ureteral stone, which has been successfully resolved with Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL) and the first of its kind where a sufficient degree of stone disintegration has been achieved after a single session with a complete stone clearance during the follow-up. Radiological examination showed an inferior type of CFRE with stone in the proximal part of the ureter of the upper kidney. ESWL is an acceptable and effective treatment option in CFRE patients due to the minimally invasive approach, potentially high stone-free rate, and rare complications.",Cureus,eng,2020,10
Coexistence of a rare type of ectopic kidney with atypical renal vasculature.,"Knowledge of anatomical anomalies is significant for all specialists in clinical practice and may prevent serious complications following medical procedures. This report presents the rare crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) with atypical renal vasculature in cadaver of a 68-year-old man. The ectopic kidney was located on right side with four renal veins, three renal arteries, two ureters, where one of them is double. The embryological background, as well as the potential clinical significance of this morphological variation, is discussed. An interventional radiological and surgical procedure should be appropriately implemented to treat anomalies of vessels and CFRE.",Anatomical science international,eng,2021,03

Incidentally detected pancake kidney: a case report.,"Congenital anomalies of the urinary system are very common and have extremely varied presentation. Among them, the most rarely found structural anomaly is the pancake kidney. When both kidneys are fused along their medial surfaces to form a round-shaped single renal mass, it is termed as pancake kidney. In this case report, a pancake kidney was incidentally detected in a girl. The majority of individuals who have pancake kidney are usually asymptomatic but surgeons should be aware of coexisting malformation of other organs and its potential risk of developing malignancy.",Journal of medical case reports,eng,2020,08
Rare heterozygous GDF6 variants in patients with renal anomalies.,"Although over 50 genes are known to cause renal malformation if mutated, the underlying genetic basis, most easily identified in syndromic cases, remains unsolved in most patients. In search of novel causative genes, whole-exome sequencing in a patient with renal, i.e., crossed fused renal ectopia, and extrarenal, i.e., skeletal, eye, and ear, malformations yielded a rare heterozygous variant in the GDF6 gene encoding growth differentiation factor 6, a member of the BMP family of ligands. Previously, GDF6 variants were reported to cause pleiotropic defects including skeletal, e.g., vertebral, carpal, tarsal fusions, and ocular, e.g., microphthalmia and coloboma, phenotypes. To assess the role of GDF6 in the pathogenesis of renal malformation, we performed targeted sequencing in 193 further patients identifying rare GDF6 variants in two cases with kidney hypodysplasia and extrarenal manifestations. During development, gdf6 was expressed in the pronephric tubule of Xenopus laevis, and Gdf6 expression was observed in the ureteric tree of the murine kidney by RNA in situ hybridization. CRISPR/Cas9-derived knockout of Gdf6 attenuated migration of murine IMCD3 cells, an effect rescued by expression of wild-type but not mutant GDF6, indicating affected variant function regarding a fundamental developmental process. Knockdown of gdf6 in Xenopus laevis resulted in impaired pronephros development. Altogether, we identified rare heterozygous GDF6 variants in 1.6% of all renal anomaly patients and 5.4% of renal anomaly patients additionally manifesting skeletal, ocular, or auricular abnormalities, adding renal hypodysplasia and fusion to the phenotype spectrum of GDF6 variant carriers and suggesting an involvement of GDF6 in nephrogenesis.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,eng,2020,12
Lessons for the clinical nephrologist: a rare case of unfused renal ectopia.,"Right crossed inferior unfused renal ectopia is a rare developmental anomaly in which both kidneys are located on the left side of the body. It's the result of a halt in migration of kidneys to their normal location during the embryonic period and in ureteral bud faulty that migrates to the opposite side and induces the metanephric blastema on the wrong side. In this article, we aim to review embryology and complete description of renal ectopia anatomy and describe a rare case of right crossed unfused inferior renal ectopia with a left lower kidney artery originated directly from an abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA). The treatment consisted in AAA's exclusion with a custom-made endograft device shaped on purpose with a dedicated branch allowing perfusion of the ectopic lower left kidney.",Journal of nephrology,eng,2021,02
Grade IV Renal Laceration in a 13-Year-Old Boy With Cross-fused Renal Ectopia.,"A 13-year-old boy presented with gross hematuria following a skateboarding accident and was found to have cross-fused renal ectopia of the left kidney with a grade IV right renal laceration and urinary extravasation. Despite a double-J ureteral stent, urinoma drain, and indwelling bladder catheter, his urinoma drain maintained high output. He underwent a ureteral stent exchange and upsizing. A percutaneous nephrostomy tube was subsequently placed for maximal urinary diversion, which ultimately led to the resolution in his urinary leak. This case highlights our endourologic approach to manage a severe urinary leak despite conservative measures in a pediatric patient with a renal anomaly.",Urology,eng,2020,11
Crossed Renal Ectopia with a Fused Supernumerary Kidney.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia and the presence of a supernumerary kidney are both rare congenital variants that are often asymptomatic but may be associated with other developmental anomalies. Here we present a case of a 20-year-old male with a known diagnosis of crossed fused renal ectopia as well as a history of imperforate anus and tethered spinal cord treated in infancy. He presented to the emergency room with symptoms of flank pain, and a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 4-mm stone in the distal left ureter. CT scan also revealed that the patient's right kidney was not crossed and fused to the left kidney as previously believed, but rather it was crossed and fused to a supernumerary kidney abutting the inferomedial aspect of an orthotopic left kidney. This is a unique example of two rare coexisting renal anomalies not previously detected on a nuclear medicine renal scan and serial renal ultrasounds obtained earlier in the the patient's life.",Cureus,eng,2020,04
Fused Supernumerary Kidney Presenting as Total Urinary Incontinence.,"Supernumerary kidney, a rare congenital anomaly, defined as an additional kidney with a separate capsule, collecting system and blood supply draining into the native ureter or a separate ureter. Small fused supernumerary units may be difficult to differentiate from renal moiety with complete separate ectopic ureter without complete evaluation. We report a case of a supernumerary kidney fused with the capsule of ipsilateral kidney with a separate complete ureter draining into the introitus of a young female thereby presenting as total incontinence of urine.",Urology,eng,2020,08
Pelvic ectopic solitary kidney: treatment with the application of three-dimensional computed tomography and laparoscopic pyeloplasty-a case report.,"Renal ectopia occurs in 1:3,000-1:7,000 children. Simple ectopia refers to the abnormal kidney location on the same side; in crossed ectopia the ureter crosses the midline of the body. Pelvic ectopic solitary kidney with hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is even rarer in clinical practice. We report a case of a pelvic ectopic solitary kidney with hydronephrosis due to UPJO in an 18-year-old girl. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan showed the Single Ectopic Kidney with irregular shape lying in the pelvis and its cortex is very thin because of the grossly dilated renal pelvis and ureter. The terminal ureteral joined the right posterior wall of bladder. The renal artery originated from the bilateral common iliac artery, and laparoscopic pyeloplasty was performed. 18 months after the surgery, hydronephrosis was improved morphologically, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was stable.",Translational andrology and urology,eng,2019,12
[Crossed renal ectopia discovered incidentally: about one case report].,"Crossed renal ectopia is a rare congenital abnormality, in which the two kidneys are located in the same side. One of the ureters, whose length is adapted to the kidney seat, crosses the median line to implant in the bladder on the opposite side. Renal fusion of the two parenchymas is common and this abnormality is most often asymptomatic and fortuitously discovered. We report the case of a 36-year old patient with no previous pathological history, presenting with crossed renal ectopia incidentally discovered after acute cholecystitis complicated by perivescicular abscess. On the basis of this observation and of the data from the literature, we here discuss the etiopathogenic, clinical, radiological and therapeutic features of this malformation.",The Pan African medical journal,fre,2019,
Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia with Single Ureter and Single Renal Vein: A Rare Case.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia with a single ureter and single renal vein is a rare congenital anomaly in which both the fused kidneys lie on one side of the body. We present an unusual case of crossed fused renal ectopia with a single ureter, single renal vein, and a calculus in a 22-year-old man who presented with lower abdominal pain, burning micturition, and a right-side abdominal lump present for three months. On abdominal ultrasound and non-contrast computed tomography (CT), the left kidney was not visualized in the left renal fossa. However, we noted it on the right side, fused to the lower pole of the right kidney with a calculus within the pelvis leading to mild hydronephrosis. After intravenous administration of non-ionic contrast medium, we saw a single ureter draining both the moieties into the urinary bladder on the right side. A three-dimensional volume rendering technique revealed a single renal vein draining the renal parenchyma into the inferior vena cava. Cross fused renal ectopia is an uncommon congenital anomaly which remains asymptomatic throughout life and undetected in the absence of renal pathologies. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) is an excellent tool for denoting anatomical details of this anomaly; the information provided by MDCT is crucial for surgeons, nephrologists, and radiologists alike in facilitating proper management of the condition.",Cureus,eng,2019,01
Ureteroscopic Stone Extraction in Cross-Fused Renal Ectopia.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Urinary stone disease in cross-fused renal ectopia is rare and the aberrant anatomy poses challenges to treatment options. The available literature on treatment modalities remains limited. In this study, we present a case of ureteral stone in a cross-fused renal ectopia managed through retrograde approach. <b><i>Case Presentation:</i></b> We present a case of a 69-year-old woman with an obstructing ureteral stone in a cross-fused renal ectopia managed with ureteroscopic stone extraction. With the use of a ureteral access sheath, holmium laser, and Nitonol basket, the stone was fragmented and removed through retrograde access. The stone composition was 100% calcium oxalate monohydrate and her 24-hour urine collection was only significant for low volume. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> With special modifications and attention to the individual patient's anatomy, retrograde approach with the use of an access sheath is safe and effective for treatment of ureteral stones in patients with cross-fused renal ectopia.",Journal of endourology case reports,eng,2018,
[High ureteral insertion as the cause of extreme hydronephrosis in a 5-year-old child with horseshoe kidney].,"The incidence of horseshoe kidney is 1 per 400-800 live births. From 44-52% of the patients with horseshoe kidney have other coexisting abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux and a duplex collecting system. Our patient, a 5-year old boy, was admitted to a pediatric nephrology department because of abdominal pain and vomiting. He had ultrasonography of the abdomen performed for the first time at the age of 9-months and horseshoe kidney was shown. In a control ultrasonography, a mild dilatation of the pyelocalyceal system in the left kidney was described. On the day of admission, an abdominal ultrasound confirmed horseshoe kidney with large left hydronephrosis. Power Doppler ultrasonography showed two renal arteries to the left kidney and no arterial compression on the ureter. Dynamic scintigraphy (99mTc-EC) revealed left-sided hydronephrosis with high isotope intake up to 55% ERPF, a prolonged time of tissue perfusion and signs of subpelvic junction obstruction. Magnetic resonance urography presented an enlarged left kidney, with a diameter of up to 105 mm, a narrow renal cortex, a dilated renal pelvis up to 39 mm in diameter, dilated calyces up to 26-32 mm, and the high insertion of the ureter from the pelvis. The right kidney was normal. To facilitate drainage from the dilated collecting system of the left kidney, a double-J catheter was inserted. Pyeloplasty is planned as the next step of treatment. Conclusion: In a child with horseshoe kidney and a mild dilatation of the collecting system detected in infancy, long-term follow up is necessary, because of the increased risk of significant hydronephrosis in the future.",Developmental period medicine,pol,2018,
Horseshoe kidney with unilateral single ectopic ureter.,"The horseshoe kidney (HSK) is not an uncommon entity with an incidence of about 1 in 400 or 0.25% of the general population. It is also more commonly found in men as compared with women in a ratio of 2:1.An increased association of genitourinary anomalies have been found with HSK.Duplication of ureters occurs in 10% of HSKs. However, the association of HSK with single-system ectopic ureter is extremely rare. To our knowledge, no case with similar presentation has been reported in literature. Most cases of HSK with bilateral single ectopic ureters have been described. The aim of this report is to highlight the radiological and surgical findings in a case of HSK with unilateral single ectopic ureter.",BMJ case reports,eng,2018,06
Crossed fused renal ectopia: case report and review of the literature.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia is a rare congenital anomaly, and is mostly detected incidentally. A 45-year-old man, during investigation for recurrent abdominal pain, was found to have an empty left renal fossa and right crossed renal ectopia with fusion on ultrasonography. In the present case, there were no abnormalities and/or alteration of the renal function. Abdominal tomography scan with contrast medium confirmed the diagnosis. Ectopic kidney is often associated with other abnormal situations such as agenesis, vascular malformation, incontinence, a palpable abdominal mass, urinary tract infection, high incidence of stone formation, and genital anomalies. Through this case report, we emphasize the importance of adequate imaging.",Journal of ultrasound,eng,2017,12

Crossed nonfused renal ectopia with variant blood vessels: a rare congenital renal anomaly.,"Crossed renal ectopia is a rare congenital anomaly, where one of the kidneys crosses the midline and lies opposite to the site of its normal ureteral insertion. Ninety percent of crossed ectopic kidneys are fused to their ipsilateral uncrossed kidney. Crossed renal ectopia without fusion is rare. We present the case of a 53-year-old male with an unusual incidental finding of crossed nonfused renal ectopia, with the left ectopic kidney lying anterior to the right kidney without fusion. The ectopic kidney had dual arterial supply: one from the aorta and another from the right renal artery. It also demonstrated dual venous drainage; a main left renal vein and an accessory renal vein. The main left renal vein joined the right renal vein to form a common renal vein before draining into the inferior vena cava. The accessory renal vein joined the left testicular and left lumbar veins to drain into the inferior vena cava. Multiple bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi were also noted. Although the patient was asymptomatic, the authors highlight potential complications related to the above-mentioned condition and the importance of identification of the findings.",Radiology case reports,eng,2017,03
[Crossed renal ectopia in a patient with a complicated sigma neoplasia].,Crossed renal ectopia is a rare pathology that is often asymptomatic.

"Bladder agenesis, ectopic ureters and a multicystic dysplastic horseshoe kidney in one twin newborn with normal amniotic fluid index in utero.","A monochorionic-diamniotic twin baby presented with intrauterine growth restriction and anuria. The baby was found to have bladder agenesis, a pelvic dysplastic horseshoe kidney, vertebral anomalies, a ventricular septal defect and facial dysmorphisms. It was surprising to find no abnormalities in amniotic fluid indices prenatally, suggesting the possibility of urine output that declined as the pregnancy proceeded. Some degree of twin-to-twin transfusion of amniotic fluid was also possible, which could have rescued the oligohydramnios known to be associated with kidney and urinary tract abnormalities. It was also notable that there was no abnormality in respiratory function, especially since further investigations revealed close to no kidney function. The intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) along with the multiple anomalies found made the baby unsuitable for dialysis and transplant, and the decision of transition to palliative care was made.",BMJ case reports,eng,2016,12
Double trouble: pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction and renal cell carcinoma in right to left crossed fused ectopia.,"Crossed renal ectopia is a rare occurrence. The majority of the crossed units are fused to their ipsilateral mate. Pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) in crossed fused moieties has been reported very rarely. Similarly, malignancy arising in the crossed over moieties is a rare occurrence too. Only a few cases have been reported earlier. We are here reporting an unusual case with coexistent PUJO and renal cell carcinoma in the crossed over moiety of right to left crossed fused ectopia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case with both these pathologies, coexisting, in the crossed over moiety. The patient underwent open radical nephrectomy of the right moiety via a lower midline incision. Surgery in this scenario is very challenging due to complex anatomy with aberrant vasculature, which needs for dissection within the renal parenchyma, similar to nephron-sparing surgery to separate from the normal moiety.",BMJ case reports,eng,2016,12
SUCCESSFUL REPAIR OF IATROGENIC URETERAL INJURY IN A PATIENT WITH ECTOPIC CROSSED AND FUSED RIGHT KIDNEY BY URETEROURETEROSTOMY.,"Congenital renal malformations are the most common congenital malformations in humans, the most common being horseshoe kidney with joined lower poles present in up to 0.25% of general population. To the contrary renal fusions with ectopia are amongst the rare malformations affecting 1 in 2000 examined cadavers. Males are affected slightly more often then females (3:2), left to right crosses being more frequent. The value of early diagnosis of asymptomatic renal malformation is uncertain, except when other abnormalities might point to them and they can affect the clinical management strategy (severe ear deformity with facial malformation, gynecological abnormalities). In females concomitant abnormalities of kidneys and paramesonephric duct derivatives are common, with up to 40% of women with uterine malformations reported to have various congenital renal abnormalities. Even though there are occasional examples of surgical repair of the injured kidneys with crossed-fused malformation the majority of surgical cases resort to renal resection. We presented a rare case of complex genitourinary malformation with crossed fused disk kidney diagnosed after the iatrogenic injury to the right ureter after emergent gynecological surgery. Rare pathology and presentation was diagnosed by IVP and confirmed during operation. We have constructed an ipsilateral ureteroureterostomy to drain the right portion of fused kidney. Urinary flow was satisfactory with no significant nephrostomy tube drainage next day, allowing the nephrostomy tube removal. Postsurgical evaluation by IVP has demonstrated a good flow from both kidney and no detectable anastomotic leaks. Postsurgical recovery was uneventful. After 2 years from operation IVP data did not changed. It must be noted, that Ectopic kidneys are frequently malformed and have an abnormal ureteral drainage leading to incontinence and frequent UTIs.",Georgian medical news,eng,2016,07
Ureteral Involvement Within an Incarcerated Inguinal Hernia in a Patient With Crossed-fused Renal Ectopia.,"Crossed-fused renal ectopy is an uncommon abnormality of the genitourinary tract that results from errors during embryological development. Ureteral herniation represents another rare anatomic event and can often occur from spontaneous, postoperative, and congenital causes (Allam, Johnson, Grewal & Johnson 2015; Pollack, Popky & Blumberg 1975). Here, we discuss the complex clinical course of a patient with crossed-fused renal ectopia who presents with symptoms due to ureteroinguinal herniation and provide a brief overview of the literature. We highlight the clinical considerations in the management of this patient and provide a potential anatomical and embryological explanation for his presentation.",Urology case reports,eng,2016,07

Rare renal ectopia in children - intrathoracic ectopic kidney.,"Renal ectopia occurs in 1:3000-1:7000 children. Simple ectopia refers to the abnormal kidney location on the same side; in crossed ectopia the ureter crosses the midline of the body. In most cases ectopic kidney is found in the pelvis minor, in 5% of cases in the thoracic cavity. Kidney displacement does not give any clinical symptoms in the majority of patients, sometimes it may cause abdominal pain, urinary tract infection, chest pain or promote nephrolithiasis. Renal ectopia is usually discovered during routine abdominal ultrasound. We describe a boy with prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of left kidney agenesis. Right normal kidney and displaced to the thoracic cavity, smaller, with normal echo-structure left kidney were found in postnatal ultrasound. Left kidney ectopia was confirmed in renal scinthigraphy, radiography and computed tomography of the chest. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) excluded vesicoureteral reux.",Developmental period medicine,eng,2015,
"Right-Crossed, Fused Renal Ectopia L-Shaped Kidney Type with Urinary Chyluria.",Crossed fused renal ectopia combined with chyluria is extremely rare. Here we report the case of a patient who was admitted to our institution since milky urine and was finally found to have an L-shaped fused kidney and renal pelvis fistula. The patient was cured by renal pelvic instillation sclerotherapy.,Urologia internationalis,eng,2015,
Laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for a patient with sigmoid colon cancer and crossed-fused renal ectopia: a case report.,"Crossed-fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is a very rare congenital renal malformation. This condition comprises several anatomic anomalies, including unilateral ureteral intersection of the midline, anteriorly-placed renal pelvises, and aberrant renal blood vessels, all of which increase the difficulty of colectomy. This report describes a case of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with sufficient lymphadenectomy for a patient with sigmoid colon cancer and left-sided L-shaped CFRE. Preoperative computed tomography demonstrated that the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was free from anomalies and that the tumor did not invade surrounding organs. Therefore, we planned conventional laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy. Division of IMA at its origin and anterior colon resection was successfully performed by careful mobilization of the mesocolon to avoid exposing the retroperitoneal organs. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of laparoscopic colectomy for a patient with CFRE. Sufficient preoperative assessment of anatomic anomalies enabled successful surgery.",International surgery,eng,2015,03
A new subtype of crossed fused ectopia of the kidneys.,"Crossed fused renal ectopia is a rare congenital anomaly; here, we report a new subtype of crossed fused renal ectopia associated with the retroiliac megaureter and thoracic scoliosis deformity. It is beyond the traditional classification of crossed fused renal ectopia. There are 2 kidneys in the left and hydronephrosis of the upper kidney, the right kidney crossed over and fused with the lower kidney of the left. It is never seen in previous reports. Recurrent infection was cured by resecting the hydronephrosis of the upper kidney and retroiliac megaureter.",Urology,eng,2014,12
Laparoscopic pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction in crossed fused ectopic pelvic kidney.,Crossed fused renal ectopia is a rare anomaly and may be associated with pelvic ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO). The L-shaped fusion variety is even rarer. We report such a case with a crossed fused ectopic pelvic kidney (L-type) with PUJO and its successful laparoscopic management. Through this report we emphasize the importance of adequate preoperative imaging and intraoperative details to avoid mishaps.,Korean journal of urology,eng,2014,11
Management of an iatrogenic injury in a crossed ectopic kidney without fusion.,"Crossed renal ectopia is a condition in which a kidney is located on the side opposite of its ureteral insertion. Ninety percent of crossed ectopic kidneys are fused to their ipsilateral uncrossed renal unit. Crossed renal ectopia without fusion is rare, with only 62 patients reported in the literature to date. These kidneys may suffer iatrogenic injury during an unrelated surgical intervention. The injury, unless self-limiting, may necessitate the removal of the ectopic kidney. We present a unique case of a dual injury, renal as well as ureteric, in a crossed ectopic kidney without fusion that was successfully managed without surgical excision.",Korean journal of urology,eng,2014,08
Ectopic ureter presenting as anterior wall vaginal prolapse.,"The differential diagnoses for anterior wall vaginal prolapse (AWVP) include cystocele, enterocele, urethral diverticulum, and Gartner duct cyst. We present a case of a patient with a known solitary right kidney (congenital absence of a left kidney) presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms, absence of urinary incontinence, and feeling of bulge in the vagina. Physical examination revealed grade II AWVP. Because congenital solitary kidney can be associated with other possible genitourinary abnormalities, a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging was obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a tubular structure spanning the left retroperitoneum to the region of the AWVP. Urodynamics revealed an obstructive voiding pattern during pressure-flow phase. The combination of transvaginal and transabdominal surgical excision of the tubular structure resolved the patient's lower urinary tract and prolapse symptoms. Anatomically, her AWVP was corrected. Histopathologic examination of the tubular structure revealed presence of urothelium lining the lumen of the tubular structure consistent with a ureter. This case represents the rare situation in which an ectopic ureter presented as an AWVP. However, patients with congenital solitary kidney presenting with vaginal prolapse should raise the suspicion for other associated genitourinary anomalies, whether these anomalies are related to the prolapse or not. Cross-sectional imaging should be performed in these situations to delineate precise anatomy.",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,eng,2014,
Crossed renal ectopia presenting with suprapubic swelling and acute renal failure.,"A 17-year-old male was admitted with a fluctuant suprapubic mass. A bladder scan demonstrated > 999 ml filling so he was catheterised. However, only 75ml of urine was drained. He was in acute renal failure with serum potassium of 6.5mmol/l. Computerised tomography (CT) scan showed a large midline 'cystic mass' separate from the bladder compressing the left ureter, causing left-sided hydronephrosis. Right kidney was not visualised. Percutaneous aspiration of the 'cyst' yielded 2000ml of straw-coloured fluid high in creatinine, urea and electrolytes indicating that it was urine. Having relieved the left ureter, the patient was subsequently diuresed, and renal function returned to normal. A CT urogram showed contrast uptake with renal parenchyma in the ""cyst"". Consequently, a diagnosis of right-sided crossed renal ectopia was made. Bilateral ureteric stents were inserted, and later a right-sided nephrectomy was performed. The patient made a full recovery.

An atrophic crossed fused kidney with an ectopic vaginal ureter causing urine incontinence.,"An ectopic vaginal ureter is an infrequent cause of urinary incontinence. Most cases are associated with a duplex kidney in which the lower moiety ureter drains into the bladder. Occasionally, some cases of ectopic kidney with single vaginal ectopic ureter can occur. In this study, we present a case of chronic continuous urine incontinence caused by the extremely rare combination of a fused-crossed kidney and a single vaginal ectopic ureter.

Proximal ureteral ectopia causing hydronephrosis in a kitten.,"A 2-month-old, female cat was presented for abdomen dilation. The patient was undernourished, and severe left hydronephrosis was diagnosed after clinical, ultrasonographical and radiographical examination. Although pyelography was performed in order to visualise the ureteral course, surgery was necessary to reach a final aetiological diagnosis and treatment. At gross examination, the left ureter crossed the renal capsula at the level of the caudal renal pole, and the subcapsular ureteral segment was markedly dilated. Distal to the renal capsula, the left ureter was very thin when compared to the right. The parenchyma of the left kidney, as suggested by ultrasonographical evaluation, was extremely reduced in thickness. An ureteronephrectomy was performed. Histopathological evaluation revealed glomerular sclerosis and diffuse parenchymal fibrosis. Severe hydronephrosis derived from an altered renal pelvic anatomy and abnormal ureteral course determining functional stenosis. Diagnosis of congenital anomaly before development of complications such as hydronephrosis could have allowed a surgical renal capsulectomy and obstruction relief. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of severe hydronephrosis associated to altered renal pelvic anatomy and proximal ureteral ectopia in cat.",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,eng,2006,12

Aberrant vessels in ipsilateral malrotated kidney associated with contralateral cross ectopia without fusion.,"Aberrant vessels is the most common cause of extrinsic uretero-pelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. Due to the left flank pain, 18-year-old male patient with UPJ obstruction due to aberrant vessels in left malrotated kidney and right renal cross ectopia without fusion, had been operated. Ureter was reconstructed and anastomosed anterior to the aberrant vessels after the Double-J-Stent has been placed. At the postoperative period there were improvements in the clinical symptoms and renal function. So, even in the later childhood surgical choice is still the acceptable treatment modality in such cases. To the best of our knowledge, although there are some papers about aberrant vessels which cause UPJ obstruction, there is no such a case with ipsilateral renal hydronephrosis due to aberrant vessels associated with contralateral renal cross ectopia without fusion.",International urology and nephrology,eng,2005,
Experience of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient having crossed ectopia with fusion anomaly of the kidney.,We report a case of surgically treated abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a patient having crossed ectopia with fusion anomaly of the kidney. One artery from the abdominal aorta above the aneurysm supplies the right kidney while three renal arteries (two from the aneurysm itself and one from the left common iliac artery) supply the crossed ectopic kidney.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with crossed renal ectopia without fusion: case report and literature review.,"Genitourinary anomalies can present a formidable challenge to the vascular surgeon at abdominal aortic reconstruction. We saw a case of crossed renal ectopia without fusion, a rare anomaly, associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Because of risk for injury to the kidney during surgery, preoperative evaluation of this anomaly must include computed tomography, angiography, and intravenous pyelography. Preoperative placement of a ureteral catheter may prevent injury to the anomalous ureter. Renal failure of the ectopic kidney during aortic reconstruction can be a serious problem. We used in situ hypothermic perfusion with cold (4 degrees C) Ringer solution for renal protection, and reimplanted the aberrant renal artery. The postoperative course was good, without major complications. The procedure for renal preservation must be selected on the basis of anatomic findings. We review the literature and present the first case of crossed renal ectopia.",Journal of vascular surgery,eng,2003,05

The calcified shadow existed in the lower end of the left ureter with cobra head image. He had no external anomalies. Under diagnosing crossed fused kidney (inverted L shaped) complicated the left ureterocele with a stone, transurethral incision of ureterocele (TUI) was performed. We made transverse incision and extracted stone, 7 mm in size (calcium oxalate 96% and calcium phosphate 4%). Three months later after the operation, IVP, CG and VCG revealed the down-sized ureterocele and no VUR. Crossed renal ectopia complicated many anomalies about 50%.

Crossed ureteral ectopia with an ectopic blind-ending ureter.,"A rare case of multiple urological anomalies is presented. The chief complaint of the patient, a 12-year-old girl, was urinary incontinence. Radiologic and endoscopic examinations revealed that the patient had a normal left kidney and ureter, a left ectopic blind-ending ureter that opened near the neck of the bladder, and right complete double ureters with an ectopic orifice that opened on the left of the external urethral meatus. This orifice was responsible for her urinary incontinence. Right ureteroneocystostomy was performed and the incontinence was cured. An attempt was made to explain the embryological origin of the anomalies observed in this case. We postulated that during development, on the left, there were three ureteral buds on the mesonephric duct. The first bud was at the normal position and drained the left kidney in a normal manner. The second bud was cranial from the normal position on the mesonephric duct and was associated with growth in an abnormal direction. This bud made contact with the upper portion of the right metanephric mass. The last bud grew between the two aforementioned buds. This bud was not draped by the metanephric mass and became the blind-ending ureter. On the right, one ureteral bud was located on the mesonephric duct and it made contact with a metanephric mass that became the right kidney. The upper part of the right kidney was drained by the ureter that had originally been located on the left mesonephric duct. This condition should be termed crossed ureteral ectopia rather than crossed renal ectopia, since the ureter was the structure that crossed.",Urologia internationalis,eng,1995,

We encountered a patient with crossed renal ectopia and ureteral incarceration into a right indirect inguinal hernia. Based on analysis of the presentation and management of our patient combined with a review of the literature we conclude that patients with urinary symptoms and a groin hernia should undergo preoperative urological evaluation, all hernias containing a ureter should be repaired and ureteral resection rarely is necessary during the hernia repair.",The Journal of urology,eng,1989,08
[Crossed renal ectopia with ectopic ureter: a case report].,"Crossed renal ectopia is a relatively rare congenital anomaly. A case of crossed renal ectopia with fusion (inverted L shaped kidney) associated with ectopic ureter opening to seminal vesicle on the right side, which occurred in a 38-year-old man is reported. He complained of lower abdominal pain, frequency of micturition, and dysuria. Ureterectomy with vesiculeotomy on the right side was carried out. Histological finding is a transitional epithelium inside the duct. This case is the 11th reported case in Japan and some statistical studies were carried out.",Hinyokika kiyo.

[Unusual duplication of renal collecting system mimicking supernumerary kidney--a case report].,"Unusual mode of renal duplication may be confused with supernumerary kidney. The presented adult female complaining left flank pain had bilateral duplication of collecting system with ectopic opening in one of the left-sided ureter. Since the ureteral opening to the bladder neck resulted in giant hydronephrosis in the upper half segment responsible for her complaint, surgical resection was performed. The duplication of the left renal mass and collecting system was regarded as ""unusual"" in several points. First, the lower half segment of the left kidney looked a normal complete kidney, because it had upper, middle and lower calices. Second, the lower half segment was located rather superior to the upper one. Third, the parenchyma of the upper segment which was a rudimentary small mass of several grams was separated from the lower one. But the left renal artery was single, which supplied blood to not only the lower segment but also the upper one, and the two segments were connected tightly each other by loose areolar tissue. These facts prevented to categorize this case as supernumerary kidney. This case suggests that there may be many transitional cases between fused kidney and supernumerary kidney.",Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai zasshi. The japanese journal of urology,jpn,1989,02
Origin of abnormality in a human simelian foetus as elucidated by our knowledge of vertebrate development.,"In this paper we attempt to explain the abnormality of a simelian foetus with reference to our present knowledge of vertebrate development. The various developmental defects seem to have a single common origin: the speeding-up of the progression of cell differentiation in the notochord anlage--which is the organization centre of the embryo--during the regression of the Hensen's node. Cell activity involved in the morphogenetic movements in the chordamesoderm probably stopped before it should have. The elongation of the notochord anlage was not completed, resulting in the defective development of the posterior part of the foetus. A number of pairs of posterior trunk somites were not induced. Consequently (1) the pelvic limb buds, whose posterior parts were missing, fused, bringing in further developmental deviations in the limb skeleton and abdominal muscles; (2) there are no vertebrae between the first sacral vertebra and the misshaped coccyx formed by the tail bud. The derivatives of the posterior endoderm (hindgut, bladder and ureters) were not induced either. The cauda equina is deficient. The absence of functional kidneys and the presence of embryonic urinary tubules in the pelvic cysts which are wrapped up by gut epithelium suggest the induction of the metanephric mesenchyme by ectopic endoderm. The speeding-up of differentiation in the notochord anlage also probably resulted in the excessive extension of its anterior region which is the organizer of brain structures. This explains the overdevelopment of the nose and of the neurocranium, and the low position of the ear. A gene mutation as well as a mechanical stress are the possible causes of the abnormal behaviour of the notochord anlage.",Teratology,eng,1987,08
Multicystic dysplasia and crossed renal ectopia.,"Multicystic renal dysplasia in a crossed fused or nonfused ectopic kidney is a rare occurrence that produces unusual imaging findings. In four such cases in neonates, three presented with a palpable abdominal mass and one was discovered in utero with maternal sonography. In three cases, sonography showed a multicystic mass, contiguous with the lower pole of the orthotopic kidney. In the fourth infant, a crossed, tiny dysplastic kidney was not visualized, but its markedly dilated ectopic ureter was seen traversing the spine on CT. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction was present in the three fused orthotopic kidneys. The characteristic imaging findings of multicystic dysplasia and crossed renal ectopia include a multicystic mass of variable size that is contiguous with the lower pole of a hydronephrotic, malrotated kidney; ureteral displacement and/or dilatation; and contralateral absence of the kidney and its renal artery.",AJR.

[Crossed dystopia of the kidney and an ectopic ureteral orifice].,We report on a case of crossed renal ectopia with fusion and a refluxing single ectopic ureteral orifice in the prostatic urethra in a renal transplant recipient. The diagnosis was made on the basis of a chronic urinary tract infection and a refluxing ectopic ureteral stump. Crossed ectopia with fusion was found intraoperatively. Nephroureterectomy cured the urinary tract infection.,Der Urologe. Ausg. A,ger,1984,07
[Ureteral duplication with extravesical ureteral orifice].,"The renal segment supplying an ectopic ureter is nearly always dysplastic. Usually the ureters cross and the ectopic ureter terminates caudally in relation to the ureter from the normal portion of the kidney. Extravesical termination in women leads to urinary incontinence, since it frequently ends in the vagina or the labia. In men, the effects are much less noticeable. The ureters usually terminate in the urethra, the seminal vesicles, the ductus deferens or the epididymis. Duplication of a ureter or mega-ureter with dysplasia of the appropriate part of the kidney can be readily explained embryologically.",RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,ger,1984,02

Upper limb anomalies and renal disease.,Two brothers with upper limb and renal anomalies have been identified. Their upper limb abnormalities were characterized by absence and hypoplasia of various bones; their renal anomalies included crossed-fused ectopia and vesico-ureteral reflux. Both suffered from chronic kidney failure secondary to reflux nephropathy. An autosomal or sex-linked mode of inheritance seems likely.,Clinical genetics,eng,1980,02
